# "Winning through Empathy-base Listening" - Eric Maddox
* Author: Mission Block List 1 - Capture of Sadaam Husan

Notes:
* All trained interrigators must have a second language
* In Tecrete, we have 100's if military prisoners
* We need you to get these prisoners to open-up
* First interrogation ever
* Zero sum psychologial game
  * Build a rapport
  * They have to trust you
  * Why would they open-up to me?
  * After the first day, I did not know what I would do
* Next day, another prisoner, we talked all day
* They wanted to be open to me when I was :
  * Absent of my goals
  * Absent of my bias of them as enemy
* When I was really listning, I knew when they were lying
* You have to "Get Them"
  * Can you listen to someone to get to know them
  * To understand what they need
  * What does it mean to be them
* Can we help these prisoners with what they need to work with us
