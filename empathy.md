# "Winning through Empathy-base Listening" - Eric Maddox
* Author: Mission Block List 1 - Capture of Sadaam Husan

Notes:
* All trained interrigators must have a second language
* In Tecrete, we have 100's if military prisoners
* We need you to get these prisoners to open-up
* First interrogation ever
* Zero sum psychologial game
  * Build a rapport
  * They have to trust you
  * Why would they open-up to me?
  * After the first day, I did not know what I would do
* Next day, another prisoner, we talked all day
* They wanted to be open to me when I was :
  * Absent of my goals
  * Absent of my bias of them as enemy
* When I was really listning, I knew when they were lying
* You have to "Get Them"
  * Can you listen to someone to get to know them
  * To understand what they need
  * What does it mean to be them
* Can we help these prisoners with what they need to work with us
* Empathy based listening takes minutes
* Statistics
  * On average people listen to 25% of what they hear
  * We can here 5x faster than people can talk
  * The 80% 'need's something else to do--it thinks
  * But we can't do more than 1 thing at a time
  * Mind gets bored with the rate of speach in others
  * 


## Categories of Listening Distractions
1. Immediate non-bias distraction 
  * Remove environmental distractions, Cloths fit, phone
2. Personal non-bias distraction
  * Things in your life that you are considering
  * Big meeting, sick family member, child in school
3. Lack of topic familiarity
  * Jump onto terms we don't know
4. Our bias about the person we are listning to
  * Negative bias, some really earn it
  * We filter their words
5. Our goals, our objectives, our adjenda for the conversation
  * Are we staying on point
  * Are they dragging us off-path
6. Thinking about what we are going to say next
  * 

## What do we listen for?
* Understanding the psychology of communication toward building trust
* Every time you engage in a coversation people have one question:
  * Are you making this about yourself, or listening to me?
  * Are you having a conversation with yourself about what we are talking about?
* 

## TRUST is the most important thing
Using the stage metaphore: You are the lead on the stage of your life
* Co-existance Trust - trust just enough to live in society, no accountability from the world
* Transactional Trust - When I need to exchange value with another, commodity-level exchange trust, buy-sell
* Quality Exchange Trust - High-end transactions ( expensive res
* Service-based Trust - Trusting another to act as I need them to, be a supporting actor in 'my movie'
  * Have an impactful life, __to have people come on their stage__  (Rather than trying to pull others onto your stage)
  * Freedom to act as we will

We listen to get on their stage, to earn a part in their play
* Every time we intract with another, the frist thing they are trying to figure out are:
  * Is this person gonna make it about them or about me
